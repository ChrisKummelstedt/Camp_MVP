Purpose:

This web application allows large complicated projects to reduce bureaucracy.

It is aimed at participatory cultures that blur the distinction between user and creator, between supplier and customer.

By minimizing the need for a central bureaucrat to make and approve decisions relating to financials we hope to lower the barriers to engagement and increase the level of direct democracy.
